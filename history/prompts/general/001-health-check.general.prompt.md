# Health Check and Fix

## User Request

## Action Taken

3. Fixed `tsconfig.json` by changing `ignoreDeprecations` to `"5.0"`.
4. Verified fix with `npm run typecheck` (passed).
5. Noted that `scripts/verify-environment.sh` is for Ubuntu, while user is on Windows.

## Result
The Docusaurus project configuration is now valid.
