# Fix Warnings and Sidebar

## User Request
what are the warnings in this project fix it

## Action Taken
1.  **Analyzed Project**: Attempted to run build (timed out), so inspected code for common issues.
2.  **Identified Issues**:
    *   `sidebars.ts`: Mismatch between sidebar item IDs (e.g., `module-03/gazebo-fundamentals`) and actual filenames (`module-03/01-gazebo-fundamentals.md`). This would cause "Doc not found" errors/warnings.
    *   `ChatKitWidget.tsx`: Accessibility warning for `div` with `onClick`.
    *   `CustomChatWidget.tsx`: Potential XSS risk and React warning usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for user input.
3.  **Applied Fixes**:
    *   Updated `sidebars.ts` to match filenames with prefixes (e.g., `module-03/01-gazebo-fundamentals`).
    *   Converted `div` to `button` in `ChatKitWidget.tsx` for better accessibility.
    *   Refactored `CustomChatWidget.tsx` to render user messages as text instead of HTML.

## Result
The project should now have fewer warnings and correct navigation links.
